# Credit Risk Assessment Using Decision Trees ðŸ’³

Welcome to my Credit Risk Assessment project! ðŸŒŸ In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using Decision Trees on a Kaggle dataset. This is a part of my journey to become an ML Engineer as a BCA student passionate about AI/ML.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a customer will default on a loan (0: Non-Default, 1: Default).
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset (32,000+ rows).
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier.
- **Results**:
  - Accuracy: 87%
  - Precision for Defaults (Class 1): 71%
  - Recall for Defaults (Class 1): 67%
  - F1-Score for Defaults (Class 1): 69%
